Sweetter 3.0 is an opensource modular microblogging system. Its goal is to provide
a customizable communication system for communities, departments or
enterprises. Sweetter is opensource software: you can use it, study it, modify
it and distribute it under the Affero GPL license terms.

All aspects of Sweetter3 are being designed with the single goal to help people
to collaborate easily, imposing as little as possible on the way people
communicate.

This development started as the University Final Project of BigChuvi and
Penyaskito at  Escuela Técnica Superior de Ingeniería Informática,  Universidad
de Sevilla, with the benevolence and collaboration of danigm (creator of
sweetter 2.0), and under the exceptional direction of Zifra.
